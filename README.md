# AN-INTELLIGENT-DATA-DRIVEN-MODEL-TO-SECURE-INTRAVECHICLE-COMMUNICATION
This project addresses cyber attacks in electric vehicles by proposing a secured framework using an improved support vector machine model for anomaly detection on the CAN bus protocol. An optimization algorithm based on the social spider algorithm enhances the model's capabilities, demonstrating high performance against DoS attacks in simulations.
